<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>My name is Jermaine and I have been writing songs for about 2 years and making beats for 1. My earliest memories are those of sitting on the couch with my dad watching music videos so the love of music has been around ever since I was young. I picked up my first instrument when I was 12 and it was a trombone. I played trombone from 6th grade all the way through 12th. That last year of high school was a pivotal part of what my decision for a career I was going to pursue. I played footbal all 4 years of high school and I knew that I didn't want to pursue that so I was at a cross roads. Thankfully it took some consideration; I decided to go into audio production/engineering because music felt apart of me and as a creative it only felt right. So now I am here to help you to get started. Music production to me is the most important part.  </p>

	<p>&nbsp;During the mid-1970’s a small group of Christians in a small rural church between Macon and Moweaqua began collecting clothing, appliances and other household items for 3 United Methodist Mission efforts in the Appalachian Mountains of Eastern Kentucky. In the fall, after the harvest, we would sort the items, load them into pickup trucks and deliver them to the Missions. At first it was just a small group, maybe 8-10 pickups but after a while it began to grow and other churches and denominations joined our effort. This continued for many years and our caravan would sometimes have as many as 25-30 vehicles making the trip. In 1997 the name Central Illinois Christians in Mission was given to the group. We found there were many needs in our local communities as well as in the Appalachian area. Some of the men involved in the effort had now retired and were able to spend more time in locating and collecting the clothing, furniture and appliances. We began working with local Social Agencies and non-profit Agencies who were already reaching out to families and individuals in need. We collected items in a small garage at the Mt. Zion United Methodist Church and a couple of old box trailers that were donated to our cause. We purchased our first box truck in 2003 from the Methodist Mountain Mission in Jackson, KY to help pick up the items that were being donated. This truck enabled us to haul larger quantities of donated items and also assist other agencies with food pick ups. We continued to support the mission effort in Eastern Kentucky while assisting local families with good usable beds, furniture, appliances and household items throughout the year. In the fall of 2006, CICIM decided to incorporate as a 501(C)(3) non-profit public charity and apply for tax exempt status. CICIM stepped out in faith and purchased a newer 24 ft box truck (2003 International) to go along with our 6X12 enclosed trailer. We were now receiving beds, dressers and other furniture from local State Colleges and Universities. CICIM began working with Hospital Sisters Mission Outreach in Springfield, picking up the used furniture from hospitals needed for our Ministry but not necessarily usable in theirs. God continued to open doors and bless our Ministry. In 2007 CICIM was offered a building that had been a dry cleaning business but had been closed for several years. We cleaned out all the old machinery and junk in return for free rent until the new owners decided what the building would be used for. The building had no electricity, gas or water but it was a roof over our head. We were also given the office area of a building Habitat for Humanity owned to use for our clothing ministry. We continued to pray for a place we could call home. God answered our prayers in February of 2008 when a family in our church gave us a 5600 sq. ft. building and 5 lots on the East side of Decatur. It had been an old machine shop but had been empty for many years and was no longer needed. With the help of many volunteers and donated materials the building was dedicated to the Glory of God in August of 2008 for the purpose of serving those in need. We are truly Blessed!</p>
